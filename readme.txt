A prototype Turn Based Strategy game.

Players control a group of units on a 16 x 16 tile board. A similar turn system to the battles in heroes of might and magic. Units have slots to equip weapons, armor and rings etc.

The game is currently playable with these controls
Q - quit
W - wait 1.0 turns
S - change spell (units with a spellbook only)
C - cast spell
N - select next unit
M - display item menu (only available at time == 0.0)

Left Click - move, attack, select Right Click - show unit inventory

There is no in game way to select and equip items at the moment. Units are randomly generated.

Artwork is currently an old Crawl Stone Soup tile set
